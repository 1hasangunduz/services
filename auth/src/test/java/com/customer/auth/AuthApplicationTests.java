package com.customer.auth;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

@SpringBootTest
class AuthApplicationTests {

	@Test
	void contextLoads() {
	}



}
```

The `@SpringBootTest` annotation is used to tell Spring Boot to look for a main configuration class (one with `@SpringBootApplication` for instance) and use that to start a Spring application context. You can also use the `@SpringBootTest` annotation to specify the configuration of the application context using the `classes` attribute or the `value` attribute.

The `@Test` annotation tells JUnit that the public void method to which it is attached can be run as a test case. To run the method, JUnit first constructs a fresh instance of the class then invokes the annotated method.

Next, you can run the test by right-clicking on the `AuthApplicationTests` class and selecting `Run As` > `JUnit Test`.

### Step 5: Create a User Entity

A user entity is a representation of a user in the database. In this step, you will create a user entity and a repository to interact with the database.

Create a new package, `com.customer.auth.entity`, and a new class, `User`, in the `entity` package.
